                      After early breakfast, you will descend down the crater which is almost 600m deep.<br>
                      The Crater was created when a large volcano exploded and collapsed in on itself two to three
                      million years ago. It is famous for both its geological delights and for being a natural reserve
                      which is home to some of the densest large mammal populations in the whole of the African
                      continent. The drive down the into the Crater is an adventure in itself and when you reach the
                      Crater floor, you quickly find yourself amongst large numbers of wildebeest, zebra, gazelle, and
                      more than 500 bird species. The Crater provides you with the bestchance of seeing the endangered
                      black rhino, which can sometimes be spotted in the open grasslands.<br>
                      After Lunch and an extensive game drive inside the crater, we head for our luxury lodge in for
                      relaxation, dinner and overnight stay.

                      Manyara Airstrip to catch your flight at 0835hrs to Kogatende Airstrip (arrival at 1030hrs), Upon
                      arrival, you will be met by your driver guide who will brief you and proceed with game viewing on
                      the north Serengeti following the great migration of wildebeests and Zebras.<br>
                      Whilst the Serengeti boasts abundant wildlife, it is perhaps best known for the annual Great
                      Migration.  Vast numbers of wildebeest; accompanied by large numbers of zebra and antelope move in
                      an annual pattern, constantly seeking fresh grazing.  The precise timing of the Migration is
                      entirely dependent upon the rainfall patterns each year. During End of July to September the
                      Migration can be found in the Northern Serengeti where they are crossing the Mara River following
                      the greener pastures of Maasai Mara where the provide the Mara river resident Nile crocodiles with
                      annual fist.<br>
                      After Lunch and an extensive game drive, we head for our luxury partner tented camp for dinner and

                      Early Morning after breakfast you will continue with your game drive in the Northern region. Mara
                      river crossing is one of the must see in Serengeti and totally one of the most spectacular events
                      in Serengeti. Many wildebeests perish trying to reach the mineral rich grass of Maasai Mara where
                      they will spend at list 2 months before they start to migrate again to their ancestral birthing
                      Ground Southern Ndutu where it will all start again. After a full day game drive and hopefully a
                      sight of the crossing we will be back to your accommodation in the evening for dinner and
