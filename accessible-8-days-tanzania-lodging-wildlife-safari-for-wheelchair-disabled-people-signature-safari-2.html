                      After an early breakfast, you’ll depart for a game drive
                      at Ngorongoro Crater, descending 600 meters into the
                      world’s largest inactive volcanic caldera. This
                      magnificent natural wonder has a floor of around 260
                      square kilometers and a depth of over 2000 feet. It’s
                      surrounded by a ring of extinct volcanoes and dotted
                      with watering holes that attract a wide range of
                      wildlife, including 30,000 animals such as African
                      elephants, buffalos, black rhinos, hippos, hyenas,
                      cheetahs and lions. The compact nature of the crater
                      means that you can see a vast variety of animals and
                      birds in a relatively short amount of time, and there’s
                      always plenty of animal action to capture on camera
                      during the 5-6 hour game drive. After the tour, you’ll
                      be taken to Chem Chem Safari Lodge for dinner and
                      overnight, full of beautiful scenery and memories.

                      Our driver guide will be waiting for you at your
                      accommodation after breakfast to kick off your safari to
                      Lake Manyara National Park. Despite being one of
                      Tanzania’s smallest national parks, it boasts the most
                      dramatic wildlife area in the country. The park is
                      dominated by a huge shallow salt lake that covers about
                      two-thirds of the park and lies at the base of the Great
                      Rift Valley. Due to its rich and varied habitats, the
                      park is home to different animal species such as herds
                      of zebra, giraffe, warthog, wildebeest, buffalo, African
                      elephant, and the famous Lake Manyara tree-climbing
                      lions. Countless numbers of flamingos attracted by green
                      algae around the Lake can also be seen. This compact
                      park allows you to see many animal and bird species, as
                      well as trees and the beautiful Lake of Manyara.
                      Afternoon, you will be taken to your accommodation in
                      Arusha.
