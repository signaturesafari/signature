                        tribe inhabits the shores of Lake Eyasi as do the

                        call home. With our guide on hand to fill us in on our

                        of the Bushmen, we are well taken care of on our
                        adventure. This tribe is called the Hadzabe and are a
                        group made up of about ten families. The Hadzabe are
                        welcoming of guests and we will get the chance to engage
                        with them in their home environment and to get an
                        insight into bush life and their unique hunting methods
                        when engaged in capturing game or rodents or gathering
                        insects, roots, and leaves. The Hadzabe live in caves,
                        with little fear of the wildlife that shares their
                        environment. We enjoy our picnic lunch before walking

                        After an early breakfast, depart with picnic lunch and
                        drive to Ngorongoro crater for a full day of game drive.
                        You will wake up early morning, having your breakfast in
                        the morning before starting to depart to Ngorongoro
                        Crater for a game drive, the 600 m deep caldera you will
                        descend the crater for a game drive. The Ngorongoro
                        Crater is the world’s largest inactive, intact and
                        unfilled volcanic caldera. It has a massive floor of
                        about 260 sq. kms with a depth of over 2000 feet. Ngoro
                        Ngoro Crater is the largest collapsed volcanic crater in
                        the world and fourteen kilometers of isolated natural
                        beauty. Ngoro Ngoro Crater is surrounded by a ring of
                        extinct volcanoes and the floor, dotted with watering
                        holes, shelters some 30,000 animals. The 5-6 hour game
                        drive on the crater floor will show you a lot of animal
                        action. Keeping the camera ready is definitely
                        recommended. Since Ngorongoro Crater is compact you can
                        have an access to see different and many animals and
                        birds in short period of time. The African elephant,
                        buffalo, Black rhino, Hippos, Hyenas, Cheetahs and Lions
                        are found in plenty ,afternoon you will head out towards
                        Serengeti National Park and travel in the midst of the
                        never ending plain grasslands.You will be taken to the
                        accommodation at Serengeti Heritage Tented Camps.

                        After our heavy breakfast, we head out to enjoy a full
                        day game drive in search of the migration. We will
                        endeavour to explore the range of different habitats
                        found here that include swamps, woodland, soda lakes,
                        and the world famous Serengeti short grass plains. We
                        will see the awesome sight of the great thronging herds
                        of wildebeest and zebra. During a short time frame
                        around February, normally lasting for about 3 weeks, the
                        majority of the wildebeest calve, dropping in the region
                        of half a million young in this awesome act of
                        synchronised birthing. The sea of grass provides little
                        cover and the young who make easy pickings for a variety
                        of predators, with cheetah being particularly active,
                        alongside simba or leo panthera, our friend the mighty
                        lion, hyena, jackal, and the illusive leopard.
                        Wildebeest calves can run minutes after they are born
                        and within 3 days they are normally strong enough to
                        keep up with the herd. After an unforgettable day, we
                        head for our selected lodgings where, after our
                        sumptuous dinner, we may relax by the open air fire upon
                        the ‘Endless Plain’ going over in our minds eye the
                        sights and sounds of the day, with wildlife wandering
                        by, and a Maasai Warrior awaiting to accompany us to our
                        chambers, where our rest beckons.You will be taken to
                        the accommodation at Serengeti Heritage Tented Camps.
